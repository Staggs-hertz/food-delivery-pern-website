# 🛒 Full-Stack E-Commerce Web Application

React • Tailwind CSS • Node.js • Express.js • PostgreSQL

This project is a fully functional e-commerce web application built to strengthen my full-stack development skills and learn how real-world online stores work.

While inspired by a MERN-stack tutorial, this version replaces MongoDB with PostgreSQL and uses Tailwind CSS instead of plain CSS for a cleaner, scalable, and modern UI workflow.
